# RockPaperScissor_GAME
Here I have created a simple rock paper scissor game using python and GUI , where user can play rock paper scissor game with a computer.
In this game you would able to see 2 image filed . One is labeled as "computer" for computer another is for player. There are also 2 labels marked as 0 , which shows scores of user and computer. Below of these there are 3 buttons which are labeled as "rock" , "paper" and "scissor". User can press any button which he/she want to select. Accordingly the state of image will change . On each iteration/turn ,the label below buttons will declare the winnner and accordingly score will be updated . 
Don't press buttons instantly . press button maintaining a time gap(minimun 3-5 seconds and maximum 6-8 seconds).
To make this game in python I have used tkinter (GUI module in python ),PIL (Python Image Library),Random module and concept of conditional statements and looping in my coding work.
